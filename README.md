## How to Use Docuwise 2.0

### Important Considerations

While Docuwise 2.0 is designed to be a powerful tool for document analysis, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:

- **Faithfulness Score**: On occasion, the faithfulness score of an answer may be zero, even if the answer is derived from the uploaded document. This score is an indicator of how closely the answer matches the source material and can vary based on the complexity of the query and the content of the document.

- **Content Limitations**: Please note that our system may not accurately read tables, diagrams, figures, or similar content within documents. We are continually working to improve our capabilities and appreciate your understanding.

- **Data Privacy and Security**: We prioritize your privacy and data security. All interactions with our platform are locally executed on your device, and no data is saved or recorded by our system. Once you close the app, all locally created instances and data are securely deleted.

Thank you for choosing Docuwise 2.0. We are committed to providing you with a reliable and efficient service for all your document analysis needs.
