# Docuwise 2.0

Welcome to [Docuwise 2.0](https://docuwise.streamlit.app/), an advanced document analysis platform designed to help you extract information from PDF documents seamlessly.

## How to Use Docuwise 2.0

Follow these steps to start extracting information from your PDF documents:

1. **API Key Configuration**: Enter your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the designated field. This key enables the AI functionalities of our platform and is essential for processing your requests.

3. **Submit Queries**: After uploading your documents, type any question related to their content. Our AI analyzes the text and provides you with relevant answers.

### Important Considerations

While Docuwise 2.0 is designed to be a powerful tool for document analysis, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:

- **Faithfulness Score**: On occasion, the faithfulness score of an answer may be zero, even if the answer is derived from the uploaded document. This score is an indicator of how closely the answer matches the source material and can vary based on the complexity of the query and the content of the document.

- **Content Limitations**: Please note that our system may not accurately read tables, diagrams, figures, or similar content within documents. We are continually working to improve our capabilities and appreciate your understanding.

- **Data Privacy and Security**: Your privacy and data security are of utmost importance to us. While the app is hosted on a cloud server, we take significant measures to ensure that your data is handled securely. Uploaded documents are processed in real-time, and we do not store them or any extracted information longer than necessary to provide answers to your queries. We design our data handling practices to respect user privacy and comply with data protection regulations. However, users should be aware that data is transmitted over the internet to our server for processing. We encourage users to review our privacy policy for detailed information on how data is managed and protected.

Thank you for choosing Docuwise 2.0. We are committed to providing you with a reliable and efficient service for all your document analysis needs.
